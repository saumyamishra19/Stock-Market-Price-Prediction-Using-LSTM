# LSTMTimeSeriesForecasting
This repository contains code for building, training, and evaluating an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time series forecasting. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.


# Introduction
Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains such as finance, weather forecasting, stock market analysis, and more. This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM neural network to predict future values in a time series dataset.

# Usage
Follow these steps to use the code in this repository:

- Prepare the Data: Place your time series data in the data directory or modify the Data class to read from your source.
- Train the Model: Use the LSTMTrainer class to train your LSTM model.
- Evaluate the Model: Use the provided methods to evaluate the model's performance.
- Visualize the Results: Generate plots to visualize the actual vs. predicted values.


# Dataset
Ensure all dataset is in a CSV format with a Date column and at least one feature column, such as Close for stock prices. Place your dataset in the data directory.
